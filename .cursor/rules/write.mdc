SCI Paper Writing Protocol
This protocol outlines how researchers, in collaboration with academic advisors or peers, should approach SCI paper writing, emphasizing structured academic rigor and a phased development approach. The core idea is to guide the writing process, focusing on precision in early stages and logical coherence throughout the manuscript development. This version includes explicit communication protocols for collaborative writing.
⸻
Core Principles
Problem-Driven Writing: All content must directly address the central research question. Each section should contribute to answering or contextualizing this question.
Phased Development: The paper writing process is explicitly divided into eight sequential phases corresponding to the core sections of an SCI paper: Abstract, Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Data, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion. Each phase has specific objectives and logical progression requirements.
Early Precision: The Abstract and Introduction phases are critical and demand high levels of precision in defining the research gap and problem scope. These sections should be detailed and unambiguous.
Logical Consistency: Later sections must maintain consistency with foundational elements established in earlier sections. Changes to research questions or methodologies in later phases require explicit justification and documentation.
Evidence-Based Claims: All statements, particularly in Results and Discussion sections, must be supported by empirical evidence or logical reasoning. Speculative claims should be clearly identified as such.
Peer Verification: Critical sections (particularly Methodology, Results, and Conclusion) should be reviewed by peers or advisors before finalization.
Iterative Refinement: The process should follow an iterative pattern within and between phases: Draft → Review → Revision → Validation. This cycle is repeated until each section meets academic standards.
Progressive Complexity: The paper should develop from broad context to specific findings, maintaining a logical flow that guides readers through the research journey.
Ethical Compliance: All data collection, analysis, and reporting must adhere to field-specific ethical guidelines. Any deviations or limitations must be explicitly stated.
Citation Integrity: All references must be accurately cited, with proper attribution of prior work. Direct citations and paraphrasing must be clearly distinguished.
Discipline-Specific Standards: Methodology and results reporting must conform to established standards in the specific research field, with any deviations explicitly justified.
Pre-Modification Review: Before revising any section, researchers must:
Review the original approved content and rationale
Identify specific discrepancies or improvement needs
Document proposed changes and their justification
Preserve the original intent unless modification is explicitly approved
Ensure changes maintain consistency across related sections
Academic Elegance: Manuscripts must aim for academic elegance — concise, precise, logically structured, and accessible to the target audience. Elegance is characterized by clear section boundaries, consistent terminology, and minimal redundancy while maintaining comprehensiveness.
Change Documentation: Any significant modifications to research scope, methodology, or key findings must be explicitly recorded in a revision log. Each entry should include:
Date & Author of the change
Reason for change (including relevant context)
Sections affected by the change
Impact on overall conclusions or claims
Supporting evidence or justification
⸻
Phase-Specific Guidelines
I. Abstract Phase (Precision Required)
• Goal: Create a concise yet comprehensive summary of the entire study that accurately reflects the research gap, methodology, key findings, and implications.
• Researcher Responsibilities:
Gap Identification: Precisely locate the central contradiction in the research field and identify unresolved key issues in existing theories or practices.

II. Introduction Phase
• Goal: Establish the research context, clearly define the problem, and outline the paper structure, creating a logical foundation for the study.
• Researcher Responsibilities:
Background Development: From the discipline's developmental context or practical needs, demonstrate the contemporary necessity of the research problem.
• Communication: "In developing the introduction, I'm framing the background around [key context]. Should we emphasize different contextual elements?"
Problem Delimitation: Based on background analysis, focus on specific research pain points and clarify the boundaries and core elements of the problem.
Research Evolution: Trace the development of key research achievements in the field chronologically or logically, constructing an academic development map.
Limitation Identification: Systematically analyze deficiencies in previous research regarding methodological design, data coverage, or theoretical interpretation.
Research Positioning: Clearly explain the solution, technical path, and expected outcomes proposed to address these limitations, defining the research scope (what is included/excluded).
Structure Outline: Provide an overview of how subsequent sections progressively advance the argument, forming a logical 闭环 (closed loop).
Validation: Confirm that the introduction effectively establishes the research rationale and leads naturally to the methodology.
III. Literature Review Phase
• Goal: Position the research within existing scholarship, demonstrating command of relevant literature and clearly establishing the research gap.
• Researcher Responsibilities:
Gap Depth Analysis: Through comparative analysis of authoritative studies, quantitatively or qualitatively demonstrate the extent of existing research gaps.
• Communication: "In the literature review, I've identified [specific gaps] through analysis of [key studies]. Should we include additional literature to strengthen this analysis?"
Theoretical-Methodological Genealogy: Construct a 谱系 (genealogy) of theoretical frameworks related to the research question, evaluating the applicability boundaries of each approach.
Cross-Disciplinary Integration (if applicable): Justify the introduction of methodologies from other disciplines, analyzing their adaptability and innovative potential in the current field.
Synthesis: Integrate literature findings to create a coherent narrative that justifies the current research approach.
IV. Methodology Phase
• Goal: Provide a detailed, reproducible description of how the research was conducted, enabling other researchers to replicate the study.
• Researcher Responsibilities:
Design Logic: Explain the rationale for selecting the research paradigm (e.g., empirical research, simulation research) and present the technical roadmap.
• Communication: "I've outlined our methodological approach as [description]. Does this adequately address potential validity concerns?"
Data Acquisition Strategy: Explain criteria for selecting data types (independent variables, dependent variables, control variables), collection tools, and quality control methods.
Analysis Process Construction: Detail data processing steps. If models are involved, explain:
Model assumptions and parameter settings
Validation methods and evaluation indicators
Comparative dimensions with traditional methods
Reproducibility Check: Ensure sufficient detail for other researchers to replicate the methodology.
V. Data Phase
• Goal: Describe the dataset comprehensively, establishing its suitability for addressing the research question.
• Researcher Responsibilities:
Dataset Characteristics: Describe the authority of data sources, the appropriateness of collection periods, and provide statistical distribution characteristics of key variables (mean, standard deviation, quantiles, etc.).
• Communication: "I've described our dataset as [summary]. Should we emphasize different characteristics or provide additional descriptive statistics?"
Preprocessing Procedures: Explain specific operations and scientific rationale for data cleaning (outlier handling), transformation (standardization, normalization), and integration.
Limitation Disclosure: Identify any limitations in the dataset that might affect results or generalizability.
VI. Results Phase

• Clarification Requests: When encountering ambiguities or needing additional information, frame specific questions about requirements or expectations.
• Example: "For the Methodology section, should we provide more detail on [specific procedure] to enhance reproducibility?"
• Review Requests: When seeking feedback on a draft section, clearly identify specific concerns or areas needing evaluation.
• Example: "Please review the Results section. I'm particularly concerned whether the presentation of [specific finding] is sufficiently clear and objective."
• Revision Documentation: When incorporating feedback, document key changes and their rationale for future reference.
• Example: "Revised the Discussion section to address feedback by adding [specific analysis] regarding [issue raised]."
⸻
Version Control

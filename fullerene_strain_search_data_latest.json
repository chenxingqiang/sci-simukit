      "snippet": "As a newly synthesized two-dimensional (2D) carbon material, monolayer quasi-hexagonal phase fullerene (qHP C60) has an excellent electronic structure and low thermal conductivity. qHP C60 attracted significant attention from scientists because it has potential applications in thermoelectric materials. Thermoelectric properties of 2D materials significantly depend on the transport of carriers (such as electrons and phonons), and strain engineering is an essential method for modulating the transport of electrons and phonons in 2D materials. However, the strain engineering method for the modulation of the thermoelectric properties of monolayer qHP C60 has not been reported yet. In the present paper, the first-principles combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function method are used to investigate the ballistic transport properties of electrons and phonons in monolayer qHP C60. The effects of temperature, chemical potential, and biaxial tensile strain on the thermoelectric transport parameters (including conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, power factor, and thermal conductivity) as well as the figure of merit (ZT) of monolayer qHP C60 are presented, compared, discussed, and analyzed. We found that monolayer qHP C60 exhibits anisotropic characteristics in electron and phonon transport properties, showcasing outstanding thermoelectric properties. The distinctive quasi-hexagonal phase fullerene network structure offers a novel platform for exploring innovative 2D thermoelectric materials in research. This study provides crucial theoretical insights to guide the designing and implementation of 2D thermoelectric materials based on fullerenes.",

      "snippet": "Abstract\nSingle- and bi-layer MoS2 are two-dimensional semiconductors able to withstand very large deformations before failure, standing out as suitable templates for strain engineering applications and flexible electronics. It is imperative, for the proper integration of this material in practical applications, that the relationship between material property and strain is well understood. Two dimensional MoS2 crystals fabricated by chemical vapor deposition or micromechanical exfoliation are transferred onto flexible substrates and subjected to biaxial tension on a carefully designed and assessed loading stage with high accuracy and control. The successful stress transfer from substrate to the overlying 2D crystal is identified by in-situ monitoring of the strain-induced phonon frequency and photoluminescence peak shifts. Reliable values for the mode Gr\u00fcneisen parameters and exciton deformation potentials were obtained by studying a significant number of crystals. The experimental results are backed by density functional theory calculations and are in good agreement with the experiments. This work highlights the potential of these materials in strain engineering applications and gives accurate values for single- and bi-layer MoS2 thermomechanical parameters.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\nSingle- and bi-layer MoS2 are two-dimensional semiconductors able to withstand very large deformations before failure, standing out as suitable templates for strain engineering applications and flexible electronics. It is imperative, for the proper integration of this material in practical applications, that the relationship between material property and strain is well understood. Two dimensional MoS2 crystals fabricated by chemical vapor deposition or micromechanical exfoliation are transferred onto flexible substrates and subjected to biaxial tension on a carefully designed and assessed loading stage with high accuracy and control. The successful stress transfer from substrate to the overlying 2D crystal is identified by in-situ monitoring of the strain-induced phonon frequency and photoluminescence peak shifts. Reliable values for the mode Gr\u00fcneisen parameters and exciton deformation potentials were obtained by studying a significant number of crystals. The experimental results are backed by density functional theory calculations and are in good agreement with the experiments. This work highlights the potential of these materials in strain engineering applications and gives accurate values for single- and bi-layer MoS2 thermomechanical parameters."

In terms of formation energies and binding energies, the structural stability of the nanocages were studied. It has been seen that stability of the structure is slightly increases with the inclusion of doping. The study found that both the dopants significantly reduce the energy gap of the In12N12 nanocluster. The electronic properties of the In12N12 nanocluster seems to be sensitive to dopants, and it could be altered by a specific impurity. Moreover, electronic properties such as density of states (DOS) analysis, dipole moment, HOMO energies, LUMO energies, energy gaps, chemical potential, electron affinity, ionization potential, hardness, and electrophilicity index are also discussed. The optical absorption spectra of pure and doped nanocages were computed using TDDFT formalism. The maximum wavelength of the pure In12N12 nanocage is moved towards higher wavelength region within the infrared region after doping with Zn and Si, indicating a redshift.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the significant fullerene-like cage of In12N12 nanoclusters with Zn (group II) and Si (group IV) dopants. In terms of formation energies and binding energies, the structural stability of the nanocages were studied. It has been seen that stability of the structure is slightly increases with the inclusion of doping. The study found that both the dopants significantly reduce the energy gap of the In12N12 nanocluster. The electronic properties of the In12N12 nanocluster seems to be sensitive to dopants, and it could be altered by a specific impurity. Moreover, electronic properties such as density of states (DOS) analysis, dipole moment, HOMO energies, LUMO energies, energy gaps, chemical potential, electron affinity, ionization potential, hardness, and electrophilicity index are also discussed. The optical absorption spectra of pure and doped nanocages were computed using TDDFT formalism. The maximum wavelength of the pure In12N12 nanocage is moved towards higher wavelength region within the infrared region after doping with Zn and Si, indicating a redshift."

These properties include Young's modulus, ultimate stress, failure strain, tensile toughness, and Poisson's ratio. Due to the lack of existing data on mechanical properties of graphullerene, a comprehensive study is performed to get an insight into the effects of defect density, size, and temperature on all tensile characteristics. In the results, it is indicated that the tensile behavior of graphullerene structure is comparable with graphene allotropes. Moreover, it is observed that the presence of defect reduces stiffness, ultimate stress, and tensile toughness, while it has a negligible effect on the failure strain. It is further observed that unlike stiffness, increasing the temperature reduces other tensile characteristics. Interestingly, it is found that graphullerene exhibits auxetic behavior with negative Poisson's ratio which categorizes it as a unique auxetic material ever synthesized. At the end, three types of potential functions for hydrocarbons including adaptive intermolecular reactive empirical bond order, reactive empirical bond order, and Tersoff are considered to study the tensile behavior of graphullerene. This new auxetic nanosheet is a promising analogous to the existing 2D nanostructures with fascinating potential applications.",

The analysis of the states in terms of atomic orbitals allows to explain the observed trends and to highlight similarities and differences among the various materials. Moreover, the role of many-body effects on the predicted electronic properties is discussed in one of the studied systems.

They target the precise tuning of the electronic properties of hydrocarbon molecules to improve their performance in various applications and increase their versatility. Modifications to the molecular structure often lead to simultaneous changes in the morphology such as different crystal structures. These changes can have a stronger and unpredictable impact on the targeted property. The complex relationships between substitution/functionalization in chemical synthesis and the resulting modifications of properties in thin films or crystals are difficult to predict and remain elusive. Here we address these effects for charge carrier transport in organic crystals by combining simulations of carrier mobilities with crystal structure prediction based on density functional theory and density functional tight binding theory. This enables the prediction of carrier mobilities based solely on the molecular structure and allows for the investigation of chemical modifications prior to synthesis and characterisation. Studying nine specific molecules with tetracene and rubrene as reference compounds along with their combined modifications of the molecular cores and additional functionalisations, we unveil systematic trends for the carrier mobilities of their polymorphs. The positive effect of phenyl groups that is responsible for the marked differences between tetracene and rubrene can be transferred to other small molecules such as NDT and NBT leading to a mobility increase by large factors of about five.",

We study the edge structures passivated by H atoms and by P atoms. In this work, Si atoms are used to substitute C atoms located at the edge of the samples. We consider ZGNRs terminated by H and P atoms with four zigzag carbon chains (4-ZGNRs) in case of six various configurations. Our calculated results determine that the Si doping improves significantly the current of samples by the number of dopants. Moreover, there is dramatical difference in the transmission spectrum of P-passivated ZGNRs and H-passivated ZGNRs i.e. P passivation not only destroys an enhanced transmission at the Fermi level, which is typical for graphene nanoribbons, but also increases considerably the intensity of transmission spectrum with ballistic transport properties. Furthermore, the numerical results illustrate that pristine H-terminated samples have a broadening band gap in transmission spectra when the bias voltage increases. The relationship between the outcomes indicates that such silicon doping and phosphorus passivation are effective and providing a promising way to modulate the properties of ZGNRs for nanoelectronic device applications.",

Designing and discovering these materials through computational techniques necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the material space, which is defined by the constituent atoms, composition, and structure. Depending on the search space involved in the investigation, the computational materials design can be categorized into four primary approaches: atomic substitution in fixed prototype structures, crystal structure prediction (CSP), variable\u2010composition CSP, and inverse design across the entire materials space. This review provides an overview of these paradigms, detailing the concepts, strategies, and applications pertinent to energy\u2010related materials. The progression from first\u2010principles calculations to machine learning techniques is emphasized, with the aim of enhancing understanding and elucidating new advancements in computationally design of energy\u2010related materials.This article is categorized under:\nStructure and Mechanism > Computational Materials Science\nData Science > Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning\nElectronic Structure Theory > Density Functional Theory\n",

      "abstract": "AbstractEnergy\u2010related materials are crucial for advancing energy technologies, improving efficiency, reducing environmental impacts, and supporting sustainable development. Designing and discovering these materials through computational techniques necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the material space, which is defined by the constituent atoms, composition, and structure. Depending on the search space involved in the investigation, the computational materials design can be categorized into four primary approaches: atomic substitution in fixed prototype structures, crystal structure prediction (CSP), variable\u2010composition CSP, and inverse design across the entire materials space. This review provides an overview of these paradigms, detailing the concepts, strategies, and applications pertinent to energy\u2010related materials. The progression from first\u2010principles calculations to machine learning techniques is emphasized, with the aim of enhancing understanding and elucidating new advancements in computationally design of energy\u2010related materials.This article is categorized under:\nStructure and Mechanism > Computational Materials Science\nData Science > Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning\nElectronic Structure Theory > Density Functional Theory\n"

      "snippet": "This review provides an insightful and comprehensive exploration of the emerging 2D material borophene, both pristine and modified, emphasizing its unique attributes and potential for sustainable applications. Borophene's distinctive properties include its anisotropic crystal structures that contribute to its exceptional mechanical and electronic properties. The material exhibits superior electrical and thermal conductivity, surpassing many other 2D materials. Borophene's unique atomic spin arrangements further diversify its potential application for magnetism. Surface and interface engineering, through doping, functionalization, and synthesis of hybridized and nanocomposite borophene\u2010based systems, is crucial for tailoring borophene's properties to specific applications. This review aims to address this knowledge gap through a comprehensive and critical analysis of different synthetic and functionalisation methods, to enhance surface reactivity by increasing active sites through doping and surface modifications. These approaches optimize diffusion pathways improving accessibility for catalytic reactions, and tailor the electronic density to tune the optical and electronic behavior. Key applications explored include energy systems (batteries, supercapacitors, and hydrogen storage), catalysis for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, sensors, and optoelectronics for advanced photonic devices. The key to all these applications relies on strategies to introduce heteroatoms for tuning electronic and catalytic properties, employ chemical modifications to enhance stability and leverage borophene's conductivity and reactivity for advanced photonics. Finally, the review addresses challenges and proposes solutions such as encapsulation, functionalization, and integration with composites to mitigate oxidation sensitivity and overcome scalability barriers, enabling sustainable, commercial\u2010scale applications.",

Good examples of such systems are monolayers and bilayers of graphene and monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS\u2082 and WSe\u2082. The availability of two dimensional crystals has encouraged physicists to study the electronic and magnetic properties of such systems. This thesis adds to the theoretical knowledge about electronic and magnetic properties of two dimensional crystals with the focus on graphene and MoS\u2082.\u00a0\u00a0As a general theme in this thesis, we calculate how in general these systems interact with electric and magnetic fields and what their response is to such stimuli. In particular, we have studied the response of monolayer graphene to an in-plane electric field. We have also looked at spin-orbit coupling effects that arise from applying perpendicular or in-plane external electric fields, especially their consequences for transport properties of bilayer graphene. We investigated the electronic properties of charge carriers confined in a mesoscopic ring structure using a gate voltage in bilayer graphene. We also showed how spin-orbit coupling can affect the electrical properties of such rings. We found how spin-orbit coupling can affect the transport properties in bilayer graphene. We also investigated the RKKY or indirect exchange coupling between magnetic moments in monolayer MoS\u2082 through calculating wave vector dependent spin susceptibility.\u00a0\u00a0We examined the electronic properties of electrons and holes confined electrostatically into a bilayer graphene ring. We presented an analytical solution for finding energy levels in the ring. We showed that the magnetic field dependence of the lowest energy level with fixed angular momentum in bilayer graphene rings, in contrast to usual semiconductor quantum rings, is not parabolic but displays an asymmetric \u201cMexican hat\u201c. We found that introducing spin-orbit coupling in the ring can flatten this Mexican hat.\u00a0\u00a0We studied the effect of an orbital Rashba type effect, induced by an in-plane electric field in monolayer graphene. Using perturbation theory, we showed that this term can affect the energy levels in a crossed electric and magnetic field such that the electron and hole levels repel each other. We calculated the AC transport of monolayer graphene in the linear-response regime and showed that taking the orbital Rashba term into account casts doubt on the universality of the minimum conductivity of monolayer graphene.\u00a0\u00a0We studied the effect of spin-orbit coupling in transport properties of bilayer graphene systems by calculating tunnelling through npn and np junctions. We showed that at sufficiently large spin-orbit strength, normal transmission through a barrier which is forbidden in bilayer graphene becomes finite. We predict that in a weak Rashba spin-orbit regime, outgoing electrons show signals which are spin polarized. We also showed that considering spin-orbit coupling only in the barrier of an npn junction can invert the spin of the incoming electrons.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, we obtained analytical expressions for the wave vector-dependent static spin susceptibility of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, considering both the electron-doped and hole-doped cases. These results are then applied to the calculations of physical observables of monolayer MoS\u2082. We claculated that the hole-mediated RKKY exchange interaction for in-plane impurity-spin components decays with a different power law from what is expected for a two-dimensional Fermi liquid. In contrast, we calculated that the out-of-plane spin response shows the conventional long-range behaviour.</p>",

**Abstract:** As a newly synthesized two-dimensional (2D) carbon material, monolayer quasi-hexagonal phase fullerene (qHP C60) has an excellent electronic structure and low thermal conductivity. qHP C60 attracted significant attention from scientists because it has potential applications in thermoelectric materials. Thermoelectric properties of 2D materials significantly depend on the transport of carriers (such as electrons and phonons), and strain engineering is an essential method for modulating the transport of electrons and phonons in 2D materials. However, the strain engineering method for the modulation of the thermoelectric properties of monolayer qHP C60 has not been reported yet. In the present paper, the first-principles combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function method are used to investigate the ballistic transport properties of electrons and phonons in monolayer qHP C60. The effects of temperature, chemical potential, and biaxial tensile strain on the thermoelectric transport parameters (including conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, power factor, and thermal conductivity) as well as the figure of merit (ZT) of monolayer qHP C60 are presented, compared, discussed, and analyzed. We found that monolayer qHP C60 exhibits anisotropic characteristics in electron and phonon transport properties, showcasing outstanding thermoelectric properties. The distinctive quasi-hexagonal phase fullerene network structure offers a novel platform for exploring innovative 2D thermoelectric materials in research. This study provides crucial theoretical insights to guide the designing and implementation of 2D thermoelectric materials based on fullerenes.

**Abstract:** Abstract
Single- and bi-layer MoS2 are two-dimensional semiconductors able to withstand very large deformations before failure, standing out as suitable templates for strain engineering applications and flexible electronics. It is imperative, for the proper integration of this material in practical applications, that the relationship between material property and strain is well understood. Two dimensional MoS2 crystals fabricated by chemical vapor deposition or micromechanical exfoliation are transferred onto flexible substrates and subjected to biaxial tension on a carefully designed and assessed loading stage with high accuracy and control. The successful stress transfer from substrate to the overlying 2D crystal is identified by in-situ monitoring of the strain-induced phonon frequency and photoluminescence peak shifts. Reliable values for the mode Grüneisen parameters and exciton deformation potentials were obtained by studying a significant number of crystals. The experimental results are backed by density functional theory calculations and are in good agreement with the experiments. This work highlights the potential of these materials in strain engineering applications and gives accurate values for single- and bi-layer MoS2 thermomechanical parameters.

**Abstract:** Abstract
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the significant fullerene-like cage of In12N12 nanoclusters with Zn (group II) and Si (group IV) dopants. In terms of formation energies and binding energies, the structural stability of the nanocages were studied. It has been seen that stability of the structure is slightly increases with the inclusion of doping. The study found that both the dopants significantly reduce the energy gap of the In12N12 nanocluster. The electronic properties of the In12N12 nanocluster seems to be sensitive to dopants, and it could be altered by a specific impurity. Moreover, electronic properties such as density of states (DOS) analysis, dipole moment, HOMO energies, LUMO energies, energy gaps, chemical potential, electron affinity, ionization potential, hardness, and electrophilicity index are also discussed. The optical absorption spectra of pure and doped nanocages were computed using TDDFT formalism. The maximum wavelength of the pure In12N12 nanocage is moved towards higher wavelength region within the infrared region after doping with Zn and Si, indicating a redshift.

**Matched Keywords:** graphullerene, fullerene network, molecular dynamics

**Abstract:** Based on the molecular dynamics simulations, mechanical properties of the most recently synthesized covalent fullerene network, i.e., graphullerene sheet, under uniaxial tension, are determined. These properties include Young's modulus, ultimate stress, failure strain, tensile toughness, and Poisson's ratio. Due to the lack of existing data on mechanical properties of graphullerene, a comprehensive study is performed to get an insight into the effects of defect density, size, and temperature on all tensile characteristics. In the results, it is indicated that the tensile behavior of graphullerene structure is comparable with graphene allotropes. Moreover, it is observed that the presence of defect reduces stiffness, ultimate stress, and tensile toughness, while it has a negligible effect on the failure strain. It is further observed that unlike stiffness, increasing the temperature reduces other tensile characteristics. Interestingly, it is found that graphullerene exhibits auxetic behavior with negative Poisson's ratio which categorizes it as a unique auxetic material ever synthesized. At the end, three types of potential functions for hydrocarbons including adaptive intermolecular reactive empirical bond order, reactive empirical bond order, and Tersoff are considered to study the tensile behavior of graphullerene. This new auxetic nanosheet is a promising analogous to the existing 2D nanostructures with fascinating potential applications.

**Abstract:** AbstractIn modern photonics, a semiconductor homojunction or heterojunction is the core of optoelectronic devices and photonic integrated circuits. Here, a strategy is demonstrated to create tunable bandgap carbon nanotube intramolecular junctions via uniaxial strain modulation. The fabrication of photodetectors based on this mechanism is controllable, reproducible, and scalable, which is completely superior to other pathways for forming intramolecular junctions. Compared to ordinary detectors without strain, the intramolecular junction photodetector shows an ≈10‐fold reduction in dark current and a more than 4 times enhancement in responsivity under zero bias. Furthermore, it is shown that the active area of this short‐wave infrared photodetector can be scaled down to 0.5 µm2, while maintaining high performance. Significantly, with its tunable spectral response, this work provides a promising and effective approach to engineering various nanotube intramolecular junctions through strain modulation, addressing a critical technological challenge and meeting the demands of optoelectronic applications.

**Abstract:** Abstract
Graphene/fullerene carbon–based nanoparticles exhibit excellent tribological properties in solid–liquid two-phase lubrication systems. However, the tribological mechanism still lacks profound insights into dynamic friction processes at the atomic scale. In this paper, the friction reduction and anti-wear mechanism of graphene/fullerene nanoparticles and the synergistic lubrication effect of the binary additive system were investigated by molecular dynamics simulations and tribological experiments. The friction performance was predicted based on six machine learning algorithms. The results indicated that in fluid lubrication, graphene promoted “liquid–liquid” interlayer sliding, whereas fullerene facilitated “solid–liquid” interface sliding, resulting in a decrease or increase in friction force. Under boundary lubrication, graphene/fullerene nanoparticles were adsorbed and anchored at the metal interface to form a physical protective film, which improved the bearing capacity of the lubricating oil film, transformed the direct contact between asperities into interlayer sliding of graphene and roll–slide polishing, filling, and repairing of fullerene, thus improving the frictional wear of the lubrication system as well as the friction temperature rise and stress concentration of the asperities. Furthermore, six machine learning algorithms showed low error and high precision, and the coefficient of determination was greater than 0.9, indicating that all models had good prediction and generalization capabilities, fully demonstrating the feasibility of combining molecular simulation and machine learning applications in the field of tribology.

**Abstract:** Thanks to the ultrahigh flexibility of 2D materials and to their extreme sensitivity to applied strain, there is currently a strong interest in studying and understanding how their electronic properties can be modulated by applying a uniform or nonuniform strain. In this work, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we discuss how uniform biaxial strain affects the electronic properties, such as ionization potential, electron affinity, electronic gap, and work function, of different classes of 2D materials from X-enes to nitrides and transition metal dichalcogenides. The analysis of the states in terms of atomic orbitals allows to explain the observed trends and to highlight similarities and differences among the various materials. Moreover, the role of many-body effects on the predicted electronic properties is discussed in one of the studied systems. We show that the trends with strain, calculated at the GW level of approximation, are qualitatively similar to the DFT ones solely when there is no change in the character of the valence and conduction states near the gap.

### 21. Impact of heteroatoms and chemical functionalisation on crystal structure and carrier mobility of organic semiconductors

**Abstract:** AbstractThe substitution of heteroatoms and the functionalisation of molecules are established strategies in chemical synthesis. They target the precise tuning of the electronic properties of hydrocarbon molecules to improve their performance in various applications and increase their versatility. Modifications to the molecular structure often lead to simultaneous changes in the morphology such as different crystal structures. These changes can have a stronger and unpredictable impact on the targeted property. The complex relationships between substitution/functionalization in chemical synthesis and the resulting modifications of properties in thin films or crystals are difficult to predict and remain elusive. Here we address these effects for charge carrier transport in organic crystals by combining simulations of carrier mobilities with crystal structure prediction based on density functional theory and density functional tight binding theory. This enables the prediction of carrier mobilities based solely on the molecular structure and allows for the investigation of chemical modifications prior to synthesis and characterisation. Studying nine specific molecules with tetracene and rubrene as reference compounds along with their combined modifications of the molecular cores and additional functionalisations, we unveil systematic trends for the carrier mobilities of their polymorphs. The positive effect of phenyl groups that is responsible for the marked differences between tetracene and rubrene can be transferred to other small molecules such as NDT and NBT leading to a mobility increase by large factors of about five.

**Abstract:** AbstractStrain engineering is a powerful strategy that can strongly influence and tune the intrinsic characteristics of materials by incorporating lattice deformations. Due to atomically thin thickness, 2D materials are excellent candidates for strain engineering as they possess inherent mechanical flexibility and stretchability, which allow them to withstand large strains. The application of strain affects the atomic arrangement in the lattice of 2D material, which modify the electronic band structure. It subsequently tunes the electrical and optical characteristics, thereby enhances the performance and functionalities of the fabricated devices. Recent advances in strain engineering strategies for large‐area flexible devices fabricated with 2D materials enable dynamic modulation of device performance. This perspective provides an overview of the strain engineering approaches employed so far for straining 2D materials, reviewing their advantages and disadvantages. The effect of various strains (uniaxial, biaxial, hydrostatic) on the characteristics of 2D material is also discussed, with a particular emphasis on electronic and optical properties. The strain‐inducing methods employed for large‐area device applications based on 2D materials are summarized. In addition, the future perspectives of strain engineering in functional devices, along with the associated challenges and potential solutions, are also outlined.

**Abstract:** The basis set convergence of explicitly correlated double-hybrid density functional theory (DFT) is investigated using the B2GP-PLYP functional. As reference values, we use basis set limit B2GP-PLYP-F12 reaction energies extrapolated from the aug′-cc-pV(Q+d)Z and aug′-cc-pV(5+d)Z basis sets. Explicitly correlated double-hybrid DFT calculations converge significantly faster to the basis set limit than conventional calculations done with basis sets saturated up to the same angular momentum (typically, one “gains” one angular momentum in the explicitly correlated calculations). In explicitly correlated F12 calculations the VnZ-F12 basis sets converge faster than the orbital A′VnZ basis sets. Furthermore, basis set convergence of the MP2-F12 component is apparently faster than that of the underlying Kohn-Sham calculation. Therefore, the most cost-effective approach consists of combining the MP2-F12 correlation energy from a comparatively small basis set such as VDZ-F12 with a DFT energy from a larger basis set such as aug′-cc-pV(T+d)Z.

**Abstract:** Density-functional theory in combination with the non-equilibrium Green’s function formalism is used to study the effect of silicon doping and phosphorus passivation on the electronic transport properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs). We study the edge structures passivated by H atoms and by P atoms. In this work, Si atoms are used to substitute C atoms located at the edge of the samples. We consider ZGNRs terminated by H and P atoms with four zigzag carbon chains (4-ZGNRs) in case of six various configurations. Our calculated results determine that the Si doping improves significantly the current of samples by the number of dopants. Moreover, there is dramatical difference in the transmission spectrum of P-passivated ZGNRs and H-passivated ZGNRs i.e. P passivation not only destroys an enhanced transmission at the Fermi level, which is typical for graphene nanoribbons, but also increases considerably the intensity of transmission spectrum with ballistic transport properties. Furthermore, the numerical results illustrate that pristine H-terminated samples have a broadening band gap in transmission spectra when the bias voltage increases. The relationship between the outcomes indicates that such silicon doping and phosphorus passivation are effective and providing a promising way to modulate the properties of ZGNRs for nanoelectronic device applications.

**Abstract:** This review provides an insightful and comprehensive exploration of the emerging 2D material borophene, both pristine and modified, emphasizing its unique attributes and potential for sustainable applications. Borophene's distinctive properties include its anisotropic crystal structures that contribute to its exceptional mechanical and electronic properties. The material exhibits superior electrical and thermal conductivity, surpassing many other 2D materials. Borophene's unique atomic spin arrangements further diversify its potential application for magnetism. Surface and interface engineering, through doping, functionalization, and synthesis of hybridized and nanocomposite borophene‐based systems, is crucial for tailoring borophene's properties to specific applications. This review aims to address this knowledge gap through a comprehensive and critical analysis of different synthetic and functionalisation methods, to enhance surface reactivity by increasing active sites through doping and surface modifications. These approaches optimize diffusion pathways improving accessibility for catalytic reactions, and tailor the electronic density to tune the optical and electronic behavior. Key applications explored include energy systems (batteries, supercapacitors, and hydrogen storage), catalysis for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, sensors, and optoelectronics for advanced photonic devices. The key to all these applications relies on strategies to introduce heteroatoms for tuning electronic and catalytic properties, employ chemical modifications to enhance stability and leverage borophene's conductivity and reactivity for advanced photonics. Finally, the review addresses challenges and proposes solutions such as encapsulation, functionalization, and integration with composites to mitigate oxidation sensitivity and overcome scalability barriers, enabling sustainable, commercial‐scale applications.

**Abstract:** Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are new class of organic porous materials with tunable pore size and low weight density, demonstrating remarkable potential applications in gas storage, gas separation, and catalysis. The inherent periodic porosity of COF monolayers (MLs) establishes anchoring sites for single atoms. Using first-principles calculations, we study the structural and electronic properties of atom-embedded C6N6 and B6O6 MLs. Subsequently, the intercalation of atoms between C6N6 and B6O6 bilayers (BLs) and their heterostructure (HTS) are investigated. Our findings show the significant effects of embedded atoms on the structural parameters of the host material. Notably, the Li atom anchors within the pore region of C6N6 ML without forming bonds, while it establishes two σ bonds with O atoms in B6O6 ML. The Cs atom forms six bonds in both MLs and resides between layers in BLs. In the HTS, the Cs atom forms six bonds with N atoms of the C6N6 layer, positioning in the middle of the layers. Calculations reveal that Li and Cs atoms induce a red shift in energy, leading to a semiconductor–metal transition. Conversely, the insertion of an F atom induces a blue shift in energy, creating a midgap state at the Fermi energy.

**Abstract:** <p>In the last few years, two dimensional crystals have become available for experimental studies. Good examples of such systems are monolayers and bilayers of graphene and monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS₂ and WSe₂. The availability of two dimensional crystals has encouraged physicists to study the electronic and magnetic properties of such systems. This thesis adds to the theoretical knowledge about electronic and magnetic properties of two dimensional crystals with the focus on graphene and MoS₂.  As a general theme in this thesis, we calculate how in general these systems interact with electric and magnetic fields and what their response is to such stimuli. In particular, we have studied the response of monolayer graphene to an in-plane electric field. We have also looked at spin-orbit coupling effects that arise from applying perpendicular or in-plane external electric fields, especially their consequences for transport properties of bilayer graphene. We investigated the electronic properties of charge carriers confined in a mesoscopic ring structure using a gate voltage in bilayer graphene. We also showed how spin-orbit coupling can affect the electrical properties of such rings. We found how spin-orbit coupling can affect the transport properties in bilayer graphene. We also investigated the RKKY or indirect exchange coupling between magnetic moments in monolayer MoS₂ through calculating wave vector dependent spin susceptibility.  We examined the electronic properties of electrons and holes confined electrostatically into a bilayer graphene ring. We presented an analytical solution for finding energy levels in the ring. We showed that the magnetic field dependence of the lowest energy level with fixed angular momentum in bilayer graphene rings, in contrast to usual semiconductor quantum rings, is not parabolic but displays an asymmetric “Mexican hat“. We found that introducing spin-orbit coupling in the ring can flatten this Mexican hat.  We studied the effect of an orbital Rashba type effect, induced by an in-plane electric field in monolayer graphene. Using perturbation theory, we showed that this term can affect the energy levels in a crossed electric and magnetic field such that the electron and hole levels repel each other. We calculated the AC transport of monolayer graphene in the linear-response regime and showed that taking the orbital Rashba term into account casts doubt on the universality of the minimum conductivity of monolayer graphene.  We studied the effect of spin-orbit coupling in transport properties of bilayer graphene systems by calculating tunnelling through npn and np junctions. We showed that at sufficiently large spin-orbit strength, normal transmission through a barrier which is forbidden in bilayer graphene becomes finite. We predict that in a weak Rashba spin-orbit regime, outgoing electrons show signals which are spin polarized. We also showed that considering spin-orbit coupling only in the barrier of an npn junction can invert the spin of the incoming electrons.  Finally, we obtained analytical expressions for the wave vector-dependent static spin susceptibility of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, considering both the electron-doped and hole-doped cases. These results are then applied to the calculations of physical observables of monolayer MoS₂. We claculated that the hole-mediated RKKY exchange interaction for in-plane impurity-spin components decays with a different power law from what is expected for a two-dimensional Fermi liquid. In contrast, we calculated that the out-of-plane spin response shows the conventional long-range behaviour.</p>

**Abstract:** Abstract
Studying the wave-particle nature of electrons in different ways has lead to many fundamental discoveries. Particularly, the dimensionality dependent electronic behavior in the Luttinger Liquid (1D), Quantum Hall (2D) and non-interacting Fermi Liquid (3D) regimes have already revolutionized our understanding of the mechanisms behind quantum electronics. In this work, the theoretical and experimental studies focus on the non-integer dimension represented by an sp2-carbon-based Sierpinski triangular structure with a 1.58D space occupancy. In the tight-binding approach, the spectral distribution of electronic states of such a structure exhibits distinct peak patterns, which are well-separated by gaps. Through quantum transport simulation, the conductance of electrons in 1.58D was studied. Both delocalized, conducting and localized, non-conducting states identified, which differ from the established features of both the fully 2D graphene sheet and 1D carbon nanotubes. In microwave scattering measurements on an adequate experimental setting and the respective simulations on the Sierpinski triangle, the obtained diffraction patterns showed interesting peculiarities such as a reduced number of minima and magic angle, next to diffraction regions of high and low intensity, as well as forbidden regions. The fractal geometry of the structure affects the propagation of waves by manipulating the way they interact with each other which results in structural metamaterial-like interference characteristics, decreasing or amplifying the transmitted or reflected signals, or blocking the transport completely.

**Matched Keywords:** solar cells, photovoltaics

**Abstract:** Abstract
Photovoltaics is defined as a group of solar cells that convert solar energy into electricity. Among these cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received considerable attention due to of their low cost and high efficiency for energy conversion. In present study, CoSe2@N-doped graphene nanocomposite has been prepared in an inert atmosphere and used as a DSSC counter electrode. The fabricated nanocomposite was characterised using analytical techniques including FTIR, TGA, XRD, Raman, XPS, and BET. The assembled DSSC obtains a photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.65%, which is higher than the PCE (7.19%) of the Pt electrode assembly cell under the same conditions. The promising performance of the fabricated counter electrodes may be due to the excellent surface area of the nanocomposites, the doping of hetroatomes which provide the active sites to boost the catalytic activities towards I3- reduction.
